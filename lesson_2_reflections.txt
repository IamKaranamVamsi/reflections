What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

After initializing a repository, no commits were created but the .git file which keeps track of all
the commits made. Initialzing a repository makes it as a version controlled project, basically changes
a directory to a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area works as an intermediate between directory and repository.
