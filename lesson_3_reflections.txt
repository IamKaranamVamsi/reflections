When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When multiple people working on the same project across different machines, a copy of the
repository should be made available for all of them so that they can view, update any changes
made to the repository from different local machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes, we don't need to pull changes that are made by another person, who might be working
on a different feature of the project. Doing so will create ambiguity and makes it difficult to
keep track of the changes made to the repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks : Used to get a copy of a repository in the GitHub server to our GitHub
Clones : Used to get a copy of a repository from Github or from local machine to another directory of the
local machine
Branches : Used to create a different copy of a project that is added with experimental features.
